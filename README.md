# usb-c_universal-sink

I'm starting to fill in the wiki with information for compiling a library that will support negotiating suitable power from any USB power supply using compatible MCU hardware and minimal external components (i.e. no external USB-C controller).

Inspired because eventually I would like to implement on an ESP32 and:

1. There don't appear to be **any** sink ICs (there are many source ICs) that support all the standards
2. I'd prefer to use the MCU hardware if possible to make things nice and simple and cheap

Drop me a message in the issues if there's anything you'd like to add or see any issues.
